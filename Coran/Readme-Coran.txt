1. Introduction
----------------

Coran NPC MOD for Baldur's Gate II (Coran for short) is an add-on for the game
Baldur's Gate II, with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion pack.
Throne of Bhaal content is present.

Coran, a non-player character from the first game in Baldur's Gate series, is a
elven fighter/thief, a romantic and an adventurer. Notable quotes: "Luck be a lady."

The mod is compatible with BGII, BGT, BGII:EE, and EET.

----------------
2. Installation
----------------

Windows:
--------

Make sure that you have obtained and installed the latest official Bioware patch.
Install the official patch BEFORE installing any unofficial modifications.

Make sure that Baldur's Gate II or ANY game-related utilities are not running.

To install the mod, unpack it into the game directory and run Setup-Coran.exe. 

The first component of the mod installs Coran NPC. The second component removes old
incarnation of Coran from the Forest of Tethyr in Chapter 6. It is recommended to
install both components, as to not have two Corans on the screen at once.

Once you see the Readme, the installation is complete.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Coran.exe in your game directory.


Mac OS X:
---------

If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting
the new version.

To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your BG2 folder.
If properly extracted, you should have a Coran folder,
Setup-Coran, and Setup-Coran.command in your BG2 folder.

To install, simply double-click Setup-Coran.command
and follow the instructions on screen.

In case of difficulties:

1. Open the Terminal, type 'chmod +x' followed by a space, drag 
Setup-Coran.command into the window, press enter.
2. Type 'chmod 755' followed by a space, drag Setup-Coran
into the window, press enter.
3. Double-click Setup-Coran.command,
the installation process should now proceed.

To reinstall or uninstall the mod, run Setup-Coran.command
in your game directory.

3. General Information
-----------------------

Coran, a great archer and an infamous womanizer, has always been a popular
character in BG1. Domi's great writing and a romance, available in BG1 NPC mod,
made him even more popular.

BG1 NPC: http://gibberlings3.net/bg1npc

However, ten years after the release of BG2, Coran BG2 NPC mod still was not
available. So, I decided to create a One-Day(or, rather, One-Weekend) version
of Coran for those who, like me, would like to have him in party in BG2.

This mod adds Coran as a viable, fully developed NPC.

Coran can be found in the Gate district of Athkatla, near the entrance.
You do not need to start a new game to get him into your party.

In ToB, Coran can also be summoned from the Pocket Plane Fate Spirit.

Coran has a full friendship path with the PC, player-initiated dialogue,
2-4 banters with all Bioware NPCs, a number of interjections, character 
reactions and other scenery dialogue.

Depending on PC's level, Coran's experience may equal to 161000, 400000, 
800000 or 1200000 experience points.

In ToB, Coran starts with 2500000 experience. 

If you experience any problems with Coran's select/confirm sounds, select him
in the game and press K key. This should fix the problem.

4. Frequently Asked Questions
------------------------------

Q: Where is Coran?
A: Coran is in the Gate district of Athkatla, not far from the main entrance.
You should see him once you enter the area.
Q: But he is not there!
A: Make sure that you have actually installed the mod. Open your game directory
and run Setup-Coran.exe. If this file is not there, repeat the installation
process as described above.

Q: Coran's select/confirm sounds are all mixed up!
A: Select Coran and press K key.

Q: Is there a romance between Coran and PC?
A: Both Coran and a female PC may mention a past relationship, however, nothing
will come out of it. Coran has moved on. Besides, he has feelings for Safana. 
And, Safana aside, Coran is still the same hopeless womanizer.

Q: What about old Bioware Coran in the Forest of Tethyr?
A: There is an optional component in the mod called "Delete old Coran from
the Forest of Tethyr (RECOMMENDED)".
I recommend installing this component: this will delete "old" Coran from the
Forest of Tethyr. This will also make the romantic encounter with Coran(from
the Romantic Encounters mod) unavailable. But this is better than having two
Corans in the game at once.

Q: Coran's friendship path is stuck!
A: Try resting outside at night.

Q: Is Coran compatible with mod X?
A: Coran should work fine with other mods. If you want to interact with mods that 
have "old" Coran, do not install the component "Delete old Coran from
the Forest of Tethyr (RECOMMENDED)".
